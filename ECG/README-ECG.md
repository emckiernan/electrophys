# ECG recordings

The folders in this ECG directory refer to three different experiments we have done using ECG recording. Within each folder are subdirectories including written protocols ('docs') and raw recordings ('data'). Where available, we have also included our analysis tools written in Python ('code'). The top-level folders and a brief description of the corresponding experiments are as follows:

**ECGbasics**: Recordings taken by students before and after moderate exercise. Data available from 24 subjects. Full details of the protocol can be found in the 'docs' subdirectory, or on our website https://electrophys.wordpress.com/home/electrocardiography/basics-of-electrocardiography/. This folder also includes basic to advanced analysis tools in the 'code' subdirectory.  

**ECGrespiration**: Recordings taken from 1 subject while performing different types of respiration used in clinical settings to reduce anxiety. (Note: respiration was not directly measured, just ECG.) Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory.

**ECGspirometry**: Simultaneous ECG and spirometry recordings from 1 subject taken before and after exercise. Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory.
