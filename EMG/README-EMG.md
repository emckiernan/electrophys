# EMG recordings

The folders in this directory refer to six different experiments we have done using EMG. Within each folder are subdirectories including written protocols ('docs') and raw recordings ('data'). Where available, we have also included our analysis tools written in Python ('code'). The top-level folders and a brief description of the corresponding experiments are as follows:

**EMGantagonists:** Simultaneous bicep-tricep recordings taken from 1 subject during flexion and extension. Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory.

**EMGbasics**: Recordings taken from different muscles (e.g., bicep, forearm, mandible) during various activities (e,g, pushups, arm wrestling, chewing). Data available from 10 subjects. Full details of the protocol can be found in the 'docs' subdirectory, or on our website https://electrophys.wordpress.com/home/electromyography/basics-of-emg/.  Also includes analysis tools in the 'code' subdirectory.  

**EMGfatigue**: Recordings taken from bicep during repeated concentric or eccentric contractions to induce fatigue. Data available from 6 subjects. Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory. Also includes analysis tools in the 'code' subdirectory.  

**EMGforce**: Simultaneous EMG and force sensor recordings from the forearm of 1 subject while performing gripping actions. Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory. 

**EMG prosthetic**: Development of a simple prosthetic hand controlled by EMG input. Protocol available in draft form in the 'docs' subdirectory. No data available for the moment, since EMG was used only to control the device. 

**EMGspirometry**: Simultaneous abdominal EMG and spirometry recordings made during normal and forced respiration. Data available from 5 subjects. Full protocol details can be found in the 'docs' subdirectory, or on our website https://electrophys.wordpress.com/home/electromyography/electromyography-and-respiration/.
